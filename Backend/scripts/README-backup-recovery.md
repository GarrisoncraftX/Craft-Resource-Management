# Backup and Recovery Procedures for CraftResourceManagement MySQL Database

## Overview
This document outlines the recommended procedures for backing up and restoring the `craft_resource_management` MySQL database to ensure data safety and disaster recovery readiness.

## Backup Strategy

### 1. Full Backups
- Perform full backups of the entire database daily during off-peak hours.
- Use `mysqldump` or MySQL Enterprise Backup tools.
- Store backups securely on a separate storage system or cloud storage.
- Retain backups for at least 30 days (configurable).

### 2. Incremental Backups
- If supported, use incremental backups to capture changes between full backups.
- Schedule incremental backups multiple times per day for minimal data loss.

### 3. Backup Automation
- Automate backup jobs using cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
- Monitor backup job success and alert on failures.

## Backup Command Example

```bash
mysqldump -u garrisonsayor -p'crafty0791955398' craft_resource_management > /backups/craft_resource_management_$(date +%F).sql
```

## Restoration Procedure

1. Stop applications accessing the database.
2. Restore the backup using:

```bash
mysql -u root -p craft_resource_management < /backups/craft_resource_management_YYYY-MM-DD.sql
```

3. Verify data integrity and consistency.
4. Restart applications.

## Disaster Recovery Plan

- Regularly test restoration procedures in a staging environment.
- Maintain offsite backup copies.
- Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).
- Ensure backup encryption and access controls.

## Additional Recommendations

- Use MySQL replication for high availability.
- Monitor database health and backup status.
- Encrypt backups at rest and in transit.
- Limit access to backup files and credentials.
