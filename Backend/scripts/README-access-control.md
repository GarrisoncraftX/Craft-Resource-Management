# MySQL Access Control Best Practices for CraftResourceManagement

## Overview
This document outlines best practices for managing MySQL user accounts and permissions to ensure secure and controlled access to the `craft_resource_management` database.

## Principles

### Least Privilege
- Grant users only the minimum permissions necessary for their role.
- Avoid using root or admin accounts for application access.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define roles for different backend applications and administrative tasks.
- Assign permissions based on roles rather than individual users.

### Password Policies
- Use strong, complex passwords for all MySQL users.
- Rotate passwords regularly.
- Store credentials securely (e.g., environment variables, secret managers).

## User Management

### Application Users
- Create dedicated MySQL users for each backend application (Java, Node.js, Python).
- Grant only required CRUD permissions on the `craft_resource_management` database.
- Restrict user access to specific hosts or IP addresses.

### Administrative Users
- Separate administrative users with elevated privileges.
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible.

## Permission Management

- Use `GRANT` statements to assign permissions explicitly.
- Regularly review and audit user permissions.
- Revoke unnecessary permissions promptly.

## Connection Security

- Use SSL/TLS for MySQL connections to encrypt data in transit.
- Limit network exposure of the MySQL server (firewalls, VPNs).

## Monitoring and Auditing

- Enable MySQL audit logging to track user activities.
- Monitor failed login attempts and unusual access patterns.

## Backup User

- Create a dedicated backup user with permissions to perform backups.
- Restrict backup user access to backup servers only.

## Summary

| User Type          | Permissions                  | Notes                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Application Users  | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | Limited to application needs   |
| Backup User        | SELECT, LOCK TABLES, SHOW VIEW | For backup operations          |
| Admin Users        | ALL PRIVILEGES               | For database administration    |
